# Chatbot for College Admission Queries

This project was developed during a summer internship focused on the practical applications of AI and machine learning. The chatbot is designed to assist prospective students by answering frequently asked questions related to college admissions.

 It combines basic NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques using NLTK with a machine learning model for intent classification. The dataset utilized is a custom collection of admission-related questions and responses. The chatbot is deployed through a user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit.

This work reflects my sincere effort to apply my learning effectively. Iâ€™m open to feedback and truly grateful for the opportunity to build and share something meaningful.
